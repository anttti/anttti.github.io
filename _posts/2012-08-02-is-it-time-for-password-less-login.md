Even though I solve the password problem with <a href="https://agilebits.com/onepassword">1Password</a>, I can easily see what a wonderful idea this might be for the not-so-computer-savvy people.

Especially since OpenID&#8217;s an incomprehensible mess and <a href="http://hueniverse.com/2012/07/oauth-2-0-and-the-road-to-hell/">OAuth is failing too</a>.
