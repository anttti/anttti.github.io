<a href="http://www.marco.org/2012/10/11/the-magazine">Finally, a reason for Newsstand.app to exist</a>

I&#8217;ve been hiding the iOS Newsstand.app on the very last of my iPhone screens, just because I cannot shove it into an Apple folder (where I put all of the unnecessary-for-me-yet-impossible-to-delete apps such as Stocks).

So yesterday <a href="http://marco.org">Marco Arment</a> released his New Thing, The Magazine, a Newsstand publification about technology. I do recommend you to check it out,  based on the first issue it&#8217;s golden.

Which means no more hiding in the back, Newsstand.
