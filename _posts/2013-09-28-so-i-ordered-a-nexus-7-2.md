Yesterday I went an ordered a WiFi-only Nexus 7&#160;2&#160;<sup id="fnref:p62490867849-name"><a href="p62490867849-name" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. Me, a guy who&#8217;s somewhat deeply invested in the Apple ecosystem! Also, me, who&#8217;s been pretty vocal about how dumb it is to buy a tablet without cellular connectivity. Yep. Here&#8217;s why:

<ul>
<li>I read a lot of books.</li>
<li>Most of the stuff I read is technical (contains source code), thus PDFs are the only viable format.</li>
<li>E-ink readers suck at PDFs, I need a good color display and a fluid reading experience.</li>
<li>My current 9.7&#8221; iPad is too heavy for comfortably reading books.</li>
<li>iPad mini has a perfect size and weight, but it&#8217;s screen makes my eyes bleed after using retina-only devices (iPhone, iPad, MBP).</li>
<li>Retina iPad mini&#8217;s won&#8217;t be here this year. (Or so I believe. If they really release a retina mini next month, awesome, then Nexus goes to my wife and I&#8217;ll just buy that for me, problem solved!)</li>
<li>Looking around the tablet space, I see iPads (ruled out above), Surfaces (also heavy and clunky) and the Android options.</li>
<li>If I&#8217;d go Android, it&#8217;d have to be vanilla, Samsung is not coming to my home.</li>
<li>Thus leaving me pretty much with just one choice: the new Nexus 7.</li>
</ul>
Regarding the WiFi-only choice, it&#8217;s simple:

<ul>
<li>Reading books while commuting requires no connectivity.</li>
<li>I already have two ways to get online while mobile; my iPhone and my iPad.</li>
<li>WiFi-only Nexus is way cheaper than the LTE one.</li>
</ul>
Nexus 7 came to retail stores yesterday here in Finland. The cheapest price for the 16-gig WiFi model I&#8217;ve seen is €269, substancially more than the $199 US price (granted that&#8217;s without any taxes while Fi-prices always include taxes). But still, seems a lot! I browsed around and found that Amazon UK sells the device for £179 plus a few pounds for delivery. I ended up paying a total of €220, almost a whopping 20% less than the RRP in Finland.

Now I wait for the device to arrive, should be here around next Friday. I&#8217;ll be sure to write up my experiences in the Android land shortly after that.

What a douche name! I know iPads nowadays are also named in a similar fashion, but it actually took me quite a many checks on various e-commerce sites to be sure I was looking at the new Nexus 7&#160;2 2013 and not the old sucky one. <a href="p62490867849-name" rev="footnote">↩</a>
