This subject is probably beaten to death already, but just a couple of the latest Nokia links:

<a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/2012/08/02/us-nokia-groupon-idINBRE87103S20120802">Nokia links up with Groupon to promote deals on phone maps</a>

<a href="http://www.chipchick.com/2012/08/nokia-lumia-900-nail-polish.html">Nokia Lumia 900 Gets Its Own Matching Pink Nail Polish</a>

Groupon crap and nail polish? Please.
