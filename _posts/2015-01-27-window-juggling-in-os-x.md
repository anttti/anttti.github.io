Lets face it: out of the box, window management in OS X is pretty clumsy. Especially if you're like me, more inclined in controlling things from the keyboard instead of clickety-clicking and dragging around a lot. I'm always interested when other people share their settings and ideas, so I thought it might be worth the while to share mine as well.

## Native options

- Of course, ⌘-Tab
- Keyboard shortcut for changing the active window of the active application
- Exposé

## The tools

- BetterTouchTool
- Moom
- Witch
