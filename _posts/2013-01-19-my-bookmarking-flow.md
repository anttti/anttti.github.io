I live and breathe in <a href="http://google.com/reader">Google Reader</a>. Sometimes (quite often) there arises a need to save a webpage for later, either because I don’t have the time to read it or I just want to save the page for referencing to later. Here&#8217;s how my process used to go with Google Reader:

<ul>
<li>Find an interesting article </li>
<li>Hit the star button to trigger <a href="http://ifttt.com">IFTTT</a></li>
<li>IFTTT would then send the starred article to <a href="http://instapaper.com">Instapaper</a> so I could catch up later</li>
<li>Instapaper would post all articles sent to it to <a href="http://pinboard.in">Pinboard.in</a> for more permanent storage.</li>
</ul>
Then when I consumed the saved pages:

<ul>
<li>I’d hit Instapaper ~weekly and process at least part of the queued pages</li>
<li>processing meaned &#8220;read and  possibly move to a more persistent storage&#8221; such as local bookmark or re-add to Pinboard.in with appropriate tags</li>
</ul>
Then referencing to a previously saved article went like this:

<ul>
<li>Start typing somewhat relevant words in Chrome&#8217;s Omnibox hoping to find the page from history</li>
<li>If not found in history, googling it.</li>
</ul>
Why googling when the article is always pushed to Pinboard.in in the end? Because I find it far easier and way faster to just google the page, instead of opening a new tab and browsing to Pinboard.in, (possibly) logging in, and then attempting to search my bookmark library there.

So now I’ve found a better solution for these certain kind of higher quality / more important (yet not so important they’d live in browser bookmark bar) to me bookmarks. In fact, the solution has been staring me in the eye for quite a while now, but I’ve discarded it as &#8220;just another read it later -service&#8221;.

But no, I realized Kippt is just suited for scratching this kind of itch. For example, as my day job as a web programmer I run across many handy JavaScript libraries and articles. Many of these I think I could use at some future project, so I created a Kippt list for JS stuff. Now please note, this list is <strong>not</strong> for dumping every possible JS related blog post, but only for high quality content I most probably would otherwise end up googling. And sometimes it’s not that straightforward to find the thing in mind (it was a great jQuery lightbox&#8230;name just slips my mind&#8230;let me google for jQuery ligh-holy hell! THREE MILLION RESULTS!?).

So, <a href="http://kippt.com">Kippt</a>. For high quality web content. Also, it’s super pretty!

I&#8217;m <a href="https://kippt.com/anttti/">anttti</a> on Kippt.
