<a href="http://the-pastry-box-project.net/chris-coyier/2013-april-3/">On being an introvert</a>

Chris Coyer of <a href="http://css-tricks.com">CSS Tricks</a> fame wrote an excellent piece about being an introvert to the Pastry Box Project. I&#8217;ve never thought about things that way, but after reading that I instantly got an &#8220;Aha!&#8221; -moment. I have no problem interacting with people, but I also very rarely find myself in crowded places, such as a bar. I just rather spend time at home with my wife and cats, fooling around with computers, guitars and whatnot. It&#8217;s nice to see I&#8217;m not alone (no pun intended).
