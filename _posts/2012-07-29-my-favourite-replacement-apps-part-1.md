As I did a fresh install of Mountain Lion the day it was released, I&#8217;ve been slowly installing the tools I usually need as I&#8217;ve needed them. I thought it&#8217;d be interesting for the like-minded geeks to se how I roll. I&#8217;m planning to release this information as a series of posts, this being the first one.

<h2>iTerm 2, the Terminal replacement</h2>
I tried the default Terminal on 10.8 but as I&#8217;ve grown so accustomed to <a href="http://www.iterm2.com/#/section/home">iTerm 2</a>, I downloaded and installed it instead. It&#8217;s a great Terminal replacement with nice features such as split panes. And page up/page down work straight away with irssi, with zero configuration.

<h2>Oh-my-zsh, the Bash replacement</h2>
<a href="https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/">Oh-my-zsh</a> brings zshell with awesome default configuration. I&#8217;m sure Bash can be configured to act &amp; look similar, but this thing just makes sense out-of-the-box, so why not? From the top of my head, some nice features:

<ul>
<li>Case insensitive autocomplete (where multiple hits of the tab key go though the alternatives)</li>
<li>Git integration</li>
<li>Fancy themes (yes, really) featuring colours in e.g. file listings</li>
<li>Handy aliases, such as .. instead of cd .., - instead of cd -</li>
</ul>
<h2>Chrome, the Safari replacement</h2>
I don&#8217;t fancy Safari. Even though I&#8217;ve bee flirting with Safari 6 that comes with 10.8 (unified location &amp; search box! crazy fast and smooth scrolling! no Flash!) it still has some things that drive me next to crazy. For instance, Safari has a <strong>lot</strong> to learn about tab handling from Chrome. Tab duplication is nowhere to be found (except as a flaky plugin).

And Chrome just happens to be the least bad option. There are some things that I don&#8217;t like with Chrome, but it&#8217;s mostly good.

<h2>Adium, the Messages replacement</h2>
Well, Messages is the mess of ages.

I&#8217;ll be back with more apps in part two. Stay tuned, and as always, for comments &amp; feedback you can reach me on Twitter as <a href="http://twitter.com/anttti">@anttti</a>.
