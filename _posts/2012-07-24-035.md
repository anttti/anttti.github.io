<blockquote>
Well before the iPhone, and going back all the way to the early 2000s, Apple had been working on tablet prototypes that would eventually form the groundwork for the original iPad.<br />
  It&#8217;s referred to as the 035 mockup or prototype.

If Apple started working on the iPad <em>ten years ago</em>, no wonder the competition has a bit catching up to do. Especially since they nowadays focus so much on reacting instead of innovating.
