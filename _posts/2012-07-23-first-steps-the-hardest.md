So I finally managed to start a blog. I&#8217;ve been agonizing on so many things for such a long time. Wondering about what to write about? What platform to use? Should I self-host or go for a hosted service?<sup id="fnref:p27839243950-1"><a href="p27839243950-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Does anyone care what I write about? Is it even worth starting, knowing that I might just abandon the whole thing after three posts? <em>Do people even read blogs anymore?</em>

Then today at work I had a brief discussion with my colleague about the matter. Turns out, he has had similar thoughts for quite a while. So we decided to do it (<a href="http://towardsawesome.tumblr.com/">Mike&#8217;s blog can be found here</a>), knowing that both of us has at least one reader :-)

Overthinking tends to yield more thinking, but nothing concrete. Sometimes just winging it and seeing where it takes you might be just what fits the bill.
