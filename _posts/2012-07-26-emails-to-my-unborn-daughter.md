Speaking of emails, this is such a great idea by Jeffrey Inscho:

<blockquote>
For the past five years, Iâ€™ve been writing emails to my son. Shortly after he was born in 2007, I created an email account in his name so I could write to him throughout his childhood and then turn the account over to him when he was of age.

</blockquote>
Definitely something I&#8217;d consider doing if we had kids.
