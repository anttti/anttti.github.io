Over time I&#8217;ve tried quite a few Twitter clients on OS X, some good, some not so good. I&#8217;ve been mostly using Twitter&#8217;s own Twitter.app that evolved from the good ol&#8217; Tweetie, and for the last few months a client called <a href="http://osfoora.com/mac/">Osfoora</a>.

What would I like to see in the ultimate client? Glad you asked:

<ul>
<li>Preview images inline</li>
<li>Streaming</li>
<li>Native and clean OS X look &amp; feel (real Cocoa app), including support for gestures</li>
<li>Global shortcuts for composing a tweet and displaying the timeline</li>
<li>Allow to follow / unfollow, see follow status</li>
<li>Regexp based muting, timed muting</li>
<li>Easy access to lists</li>
<li>Display both real name and Twitter handle</li>
</ul>
Osfoora comes close, especially the latest update with streaming support made a big difference. Still, Osfora is missing advanced muting features (foursquare and the like) and it doesn&#8217;t display both real names and nicks, and it doesn&#8217;t support gestures (the official Twitter.app is nice in this sense). So close!

Then there&#8217;s the alpha version of Tweetbot for Mac. I can tolerate it being &#8220;the most android-looking app on iOS&#8221; on my phone and on the iPad mostly because the apps are always running in full screen, but it just doesn&#8217;t sit well in OS X.

Given the <a href="http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2011/03/twitter-tells-third-party-devs-to-stop-making-twitter-client-apps/">stance Twitter seems to have taken on 3rd party clients</a>, I wonder if I ever get to see a client of my dreams.
