I used to listen to quite a lot of music. Nowadays I hardly ever find myself thoroughly immersed in tunes, actually <em>listening</em> and not just hearing music. Why? Podcasts, that&#8217;s why.

For a long time I knew podcasts existed, but never thought there&#8217;s anything worth my time there. Then several things happened:

<ol>
<li>I bought my first iPhone</li>
<li>I found about <a href="http://vemedio.com/products/instacast">Instacast</a><sup id="fnref:p27896063837-1"><a href="p27896063837-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></li>
<li>I stumbled upon the <a href="http://5by5.tv">5by5 network</a></li>
</ol>
Yeah, I had an iPod before the iPhone. Sure, I had phones that were perfectly capable of playing podcasts. But there was sooo much friction. To download the podcasts. To sync the podcasts to the iPod / phone. To find a suitable player with the ability to display shownotes, remember the position and so on. In this regard, the iPhone along with Instacast changed pretty much everything. Suddenly I could catch podcasts on the fly, stream them online and check the shownotes on my phone. Great!

&#8230;until I found myself subscribing to twenty-something podcasts<sup id="fnref:p27896063837-2"><a href="p27896063837-2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. Each of them producing 60-120 (or even more, in the case of <a href="http://5by5.tv/hypercritical">Hypercritical</a>) minutes worth of material <em>every week</em>. Now I am in the situation that I have more interesting stuff to listen than I can handle! Nevertheless, I regret nothing and can only recommend this to everyone. It&#8217;s nice to be able to make use of my spare time commuting, doing errands and so on. Talk radio is dead, long live podcasts!

Instacast 2 isn&#8217;t what the first version used to be. I purchased the IAP add-on(s?) and found myself seriously confused with the &#8220;smart&#8221; and dumb playlists and all the shenanigans. I might actually be in the market for a replacement. <a href="p27896063837-1" rev="footnote">↩</a>

I&#8217;ll write a separate post listing my favorite podcasts. <a href="p27896063837-2" rev="footnote">↩</a>
