I listen to a lot of podcasts. And when I say a lot, I mean I subscribe to about 20 podcasts and try hard to listen to every episode of them. Most of the podcasts I listen to are about Apple, iOS/Mac/web development or design. Or in the optimal case, all of the above. I thought it&#8217;d be useful for likeminded people to take a peek at the Apple/iOS-related ones:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://developingperspective.com/">Developing Perspective</a>: Very insightful one-man show by <a href="http://david-smith.org/">underscoredavidsmith</a>. Always under 15 minutes!</li>
<li><a href="http://atp.fm">Accidental Tech Podcast</a>: Featuring my favorite internet hero <a href="https://twitter.com/siracusa">John Siracusa</a>. Never under 15 minutes!</li>
<li><a href="http://edgecasesshow.com/">Edge Cases</a>: Geek alert! <a href="http://twitter.com/apontious">Andrew Pontius</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/rentzsch">Wolf Rentzsch</a> take a (very) deep dive into Apple tech.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.imore.com/debug">Debug</a>: A fairly new, conversational show about development. Hosted by <a href="http://twitter.com/gte">Guy English</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/reneritchie">Rene Ritchie</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.coreint.org/">Core Intuition</a>: Extremely enjoyable weekly discussion between <a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/">Daniel Jalkut</a> and <a href="http://www.manton.org/">Manton Reece</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://identicalcousins.net/">Identical Cousins</a>: Kind of similar to Core Intuition, featuring <a href="http://inessential.com/">Brent Simmons</a> (Q-branch, NetNewsWire, Glassboard) and <a href="https://twitter.com/macguitar">Michael Simmons</a> (Flexibits, Hockeyapp).</li>
<li><a href="http://www.muleradio.net/thetalkshow/">The Talk Show With John Gruber</a>: I guess if you&#8217;re even vaguely interested in the Apple world this is mandatory stuff. The show took a huge jump in quality when it switched from <a href="http://5by5.tv">5by5</a> to <a href="http://www.muleradio.net/">Mule</a>. I&#8217;m thinking it has to do with the fact that on Mule, <a href="http://daringfireball.com">Gruber</a> is the host (whereas on 5by5&#160;<a href="http://benjamin.org/dan/">Dan Benjamin</a> used to host the show and Gruber just murmurred along).</li>
<li><a href="http://bjango.com/articles/iterate/">Iterate</a>: The only really design-oriented podcast of the bunch. I&#8217;ve tried some others too, but Iterate seems to be the best. Hosts: <a href="http://twitter.com/reneritchie">Rene Ritchie</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/reneritchie">Seth Clifford</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/marcedwards">Marc Edwards</a>.</li>
</ul>
Curiously I used to listen to a whole lot of 5by5 podcasts. Now there are a total of zero of them on my list; a couple of interesting podcasts have ended (<a href="http://5by5.tv/buildanalyze">Build &amp; Analyze</a> and <a href="http://5by5.tv/hypercritical">Hypercritical</a>), another one has moved network (The Talk Show).

By the way, Build &amp; Analyze and Hypercritical have still episodes very much worth listening, in the (extremely unlikely) case you run out of podcasts to listen to.
