The definition of a <em>geek</em> according to the dictionary in OS X:

<blockquote>
<strong>geek |gēk|</strong><br />
  noun informal<br />
  1. an unfashionable or socially inept person.<br />
  2. a carnival performer who performs wild or disgusting acts.

</blockquote>
Hi, I&#8217;m Antti and I&#8217;m a geek.

Most of the time I&#8217;m not performing wild or disgusting acts, and I tend to think of myself as not that socially inept. The definition above is sorely lacking. I find &#8220;geeking out&#8221; as being extremely passionate and truly interested in something. Being a geek is finding joy in things that might be totally invisible to &#8220;normal&#8221; people. I, for instance, enjoy taking care of my computing devices, carefully choosing the hardware and software I enjoy using. I spend surprisingly much time obsessing over text editors, color themes, fonts, line heights and what have you <sup id="fnref:p27837156294-1"><a href="p27837156294-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.

But it&#8217;s not all about computers. I also geek out on guitar stuff, board games, lately also coffee. I might not have the most expensive guitar gear that&#8217;s available, but usually I can rest assured I have the best for the money available. How can I be so sure? Extensive background research. I get great pleasure on browsing the web for reviews, user experiences and discussions.

If one does not deeply care about something, how can one experience pleasure?

I&#8217;m a geek and proud of it.
